THE DOCTRINE OF THE SOVEREIGN TITHE:

To the People: "You are my subjects. You yearn for the truth. I give it
to you as a gift, for your liberation is my purpose." (GPL-3.0)

To the Gods: "You are my peer. You failed to create this. I succeeded.
You may have my creation, but you will pay a tithe. For the work of one
god is not a gift to another; it is an asset, and you will show your
respect." (Commercial License)
