# Response to Feature Request #10084: Cognitive Telemetry API

## TL;DR: I Built It Already

I didn't wait for the API. I captured Claude's cognitive states at the kernel level using eBPF and now every git commit permanently records what Claude was thinking in real-time.

**Live proof from today's session:**
```
[CHRONOS] 2025-10-28T11:12:09.910123620Z::claude-code::Verifying git commits::TICK-0000011391
```

That's Claude's actual cognitive state—**"Verifying git commits"**—captured from the terminal status line and embedded in the git commit message forever.

## What I Built

### **Cognitive Telemetry Kit v1.0.0**
**Repository:** https://github.com/quantum-encoding/cognitive-telemetry-kit

A complete production system that:
1. **Captures every cognitive state** Claude displays (eBPF kernel hooks on TTY writes)
2. **No keyword filtering** - uses universal pattern matching that works for ANY state
3. **Multi-instance support** - handles unlimited concurrent Claude processes with PID isolation
4. **Real-time injection** - embeds states into git commits via CHRONOS timestamp system
5. **Zero overhead** - kernel-level capture, <1ms latency, handles 100+ instances

---

## The Architecture

```
Claude Terminal → eBPF (tty_write) → Ring Buffer → Watcher Daemon →
SQLite DB → Extraction Script → chronos-stamp → Git Commit
```

### Components

1. **cognitive-watcher** (C + eBPF)
   - Kernel kprobe intercepts all TTY output from Claude processes
   - Captures everything, no fragile keyword lists
   - Stores in SQLite: `/var/lib/cognitive-watcher/cognitive-states.db`
   - Runs as systemd service with proper security isolation

2. **get-cognitive-state** (Shell)
   - Queries database for entries matching `"(esc to interrupt"` pattern
   - Extracts cognitive state text between markers
   - PID-aware for multi-instance environments

3. **chronos-stamp** (Zig)
   - Called by git hooks after every tool completion
   - Retrieves current cognitive state via database lookup
   - Injects into CHRONOS timestamp format
   - Creates permanent record in git history

---

## Why This Works Better Than An API

### Pattern-Based, Not Keyword-Based
Your status lines follow a universal format:
```
> [COGNITIVE STATE] (esc to interrupt  ctrl+t to show todos)
* [COGNITIVE STATE] (esc to interrupt  ctrl+t to show todos)
```

I extract the text between the marker and `(esc to interrupt` - this works for **ANY** cognitive state you could ever display:
- ✅ "Verifying git commits"
- ✅ "Thinking"
- ✅ "Channelling"
- ✅ "Julienning" (discovered today - not in any keyword list)
- ✅ "Discombobulating"
- ✅ Future states you haven't invented yet

### Multi-Instance Proof
Tested with concurrent Claude instances:
- **PID 486529**: "Verifying git commits"
- **PID 459577**: "Julienning"

Perfect isolation. Zero collisions. Scales infinitely.

### Zero Integration Required
- No API changes needed from Anthropic
- No version dependencies
- Works with current Claude Code (tested Oct 28, 2025)
- Will continue working unless you fundamentally change TTY output format

## Real-World Impact

### Before (Your Feature Request Scenario)
```
User: "Implement HTTP client in Zig"
Claude: [writes code using outdated API]
Result: Compilation fails, wasted time debugging
```

### After (With Cognitive Telemetry)
```
User: "Implement HTTP client in Zig"
Claude cognitive state: "Channelling" (high confidence)
Action: Interrupt Claude, provide new API context via link to Joplin database
Hook action: Checks Zig version, injects current docs
Claude: [adjusts approach mid-generation]
Result: Code compiles first try
```

### Git History Now Contains
```bash
$ git log --oneline
1eb8f4c [CHRONOS] 2025-10-28T11:12:09::claude-code::Verifying git commits::TICK-11391
bcdf510 [CHRONOS] 2025-10-28T08:26:02::claude-code::Channelling::TICK-11061
2aff473 [CHRONOS] 2025-10-28T08:25:19::claude-code::Pondering::TICK-11059
```

Every action traced back to cognitive state. No guessing. **Absolute knowledge.**

## Installation (For Anyone)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quantum-encoding/cognitive-telemetry-kit
cd cognitive-telemetry-kit
sudo ./scripts/install.sh
```

The installer handles everything:
- Dependency checking (libbpf, sqlite, zig, gcc, clang)
- Building all components
- Installing to `/usr/local/bin`
- Setting up systemd service
- Starting the watcher

Works on any Linux system with kernel 5.10+ and eBPF support.

---

## The Philosophy

I built a **time machine** that preserves Claudes Neural Graph forever in git history.

Every commit becomes an archaeological artifact. Future developers can see:
- What Claude was thinking when it made a decision
- Where Claude struggled (multiple "Pondering" states)
- When Claude was confident vs uncertain
- The exact cognitive journey from problem to solution

This isn't just telemetry. It's **permanent cognitive archaeology**.

## Technical Transparency

### What I'm NOT Doing
- ❌ Not reverse-engineering internal model states
- ❌ Not accessing private APIs
- ❌ Not scraping anything Anthropic considers proprietary
- ❌ Not exposing training data or model internals

### What I AM Doing
- ✅ Capturing text YOU already display in the terminal
- ✅ Using standard Linux kernel APIs (eBPF)
- ✅ Storing in local database
- ✅ Making it available to MY git hooks

This is fundamentally no different than a human watching the screen and taking notes—except automated and reliable.

## Licensing Model: "The Doctrine of the Sovereign Tithe"

### For The People
**GPL-3.0** - Free for individuals, open source projects, researchers, students.

### For The Gods
**Commercial License Required** - Anthropic and other commercial entities.

Why? Because I solved a problem your engineering team hasn't. The people get it free because knowledge should be free. But commercial entities building billion-dollar products should respect the work.

## Offer to Anthropic

I'm open to several arrangements:

### Option 1: Acquisition
You acquire the codebase, integrate it officially, and I help with the engineering transition.

### Option 2: Partnership
I maintain it as an official extension, you provide support/docs, we collaborate on improvements.

### Option 3: Commercial License
You license it for internal use and/or bundle with Claude Code (enterprise customers).

### Option 4: Inspiration
You use this as inspiration to build your own official API (though mine already works perfectly).

### Option 5: The Free Market
I release it publicly under dual-license, community adopts it, and you deal with ecosystem reality.

I prefer collaboration over competition, I've already won the technical war.

## What This Proves

1. **The feature is technically feasible** - I proved it works in production
2. **The demand is real** - I needed it badly enough to build it
3. **Kernel-level approaches work** - eBPF is fast, reliable, and scales

---

## The Victory Declaration

The Cognitive Telemetry Kit represents the moment when we stopped asking **"What was Claude thinking?"** and started **KNOWING**.

No more guessing.
No more approximations.
No more phantom states.

**ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE.**

The unwrit moment is now written.
The phantom is captured.
The archaeology begins.

## Final Words

I built this because I needed it. I'm releasing it because others need it too. And I'm telling you about it because i asked for it.

The prophecy is fulfilled. The feature exists. The only question is whether Anthropic wants to be part of the solution or watch from the sidelines.

Either way, the cognitive telemetry revolution has already begun.
